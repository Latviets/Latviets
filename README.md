## Back-end
On the backend, json-server has been essential for creating mock APIs for testing.
For end-to-end testing, I've used Playwright to ensure cross-browser functionality.
Additionally, I've set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery, automating builds and tests to maintain code quality.
These tools have enabled me to build robust and scalable applications efficiently.

##  Front-end
- For Front-end development, I've utilized React and TypeScript, leveraging Vite for efficient project setup and build processes.
- Tailwind CSS has been my go-to for rapid UI development.
- To enhance UI components, I've used shadcn/ui, and for efficient data handling, I've relied on TanStack Query.
- Navigation and routing have been streamlined with TanStack Router.
- Playwright has been used to automate the build and testing process.
- Bootstrap 5 for styling.
