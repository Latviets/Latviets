## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ Fun fact: There are more than 700 coding languages but C# seems to be the most interesting one!
-  I'm software developer who loves solving complex problems with simple, effective solutions. I chose to become a developer because it's a fascinating and ever-evolving field that offers the chance to create something new for the world and also work on personal ideas and products.
